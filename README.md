## General info
This is a variant of the famous video game Tetris.

## Gameplay
* Goal: Put your organizational skills and endurance to the test by clearing as many lines as possible.
* Clear lines: Maneuver the falling Tetriminos to fit them together within the Matrix. To clear a line, fill every square within a single row.
* Score points: Earn points by clearing lines. Clear multiple lines at once to increase your scoring opportunities.
* Ghost piece: Use the Ghost Piece to determine the best fit for the falling Tetrimino. This helpful guide appears directly below the falling Tetrimino and displays possible placements.
* Next queue: Preview the upcoming Tetrimino in the Next Queue to plan ahead and increase your scoring opportunities.
* Hold queue: Store a falling Tetrimino in the Hold Queue for later use.
* Game over: Stack the Tetriminos too high and the game is over!
